## Gameplay Instructions

- To move around, click the **North**, **East**, **South**, or **West** buttons. If there's no path in that direction, you won't be able to move.
- To reread something's description, click **Inspect**, select the item, setpiece, or the room itself in the dropdown menu, and hit **Confirm**.
- To get a reminder of what's in your inventory, click the **Inventory** button.
- To interact with a setpiece or item, click **Interact**, select what you want to use to interact with your target, select the target, and hit **Confirm**.
- To pick up an item, simply use your hand to interact with that item through the **Interact** button.
- The dungeon you've been trapped in is magical, and sometimes you might head down a path, only to find that the way behind you has disappeared. Don't panic, there's always a way to get back to where you were.
